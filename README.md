# Tetris
Creating my very own Tetris

# Done:

Now you can actually lose, blocks are colored, you can see the score and time, and it no longer works only on 1366x768, it should on all displays. Also, you can now hold blocks. I am aware of the issue of block not being generated randomly after swapping first, and am working on the fix.

# To do:

1. UI - work started
2. Scoreboard
3. Everything else I forgot about or I'll think of in the future - we're getting there.
