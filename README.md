# Tetris
Creating my very own Tetris.

# Note:
While this project was fun to make, looking back at it shows how inefficient my programming was back in the day.
Definitely not going to attempt to recreate this, and neither should you, because 2 thousand lines of array manipulation by hand just looks painful.
