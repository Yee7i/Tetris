# Tetris
Creating my very own Tetris

# Done:

v1.0 - Bugged gameplay.

v1.1 - Now you can actually lose, blocks are colored, you can see the score and time, and it no longer works only on 1366x768, it should on all displays.

# To do:

1. UI - work started
2. Scoreboard
3. Resolution support - done.
4. Colors - well, mainly done.
5. Everything else I forgot about or I'll think of in the future - we're getting there.
